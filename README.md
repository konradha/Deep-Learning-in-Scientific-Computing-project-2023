### Solving radiative transfer problems using PINNs

A repository showcasing our work on how to use
PINNs to solve radiative transfer problems. This was done as
part of the lecture [Deep Learning in Scientific
Computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6wHpRzhhkA&ab_channel=CAMLab%2CETHZ%C3%BCrich)
held by Mishra and colleagues.


This work was done by 
[Claudio Cannizzaro](https://github.com/caushi),
[Florian Pauschitz](https://github.com/pafloria)
and [Konrad Handrick](https://github.com/konradha).

To run, install dependencies (with a package manger of your choice).

```bash
micromamba create -n dlsc pytorch numpy matplotlib tqdm
micromamba activate dlsc
``` 

The repository additionally contains the final report and
the reference paper our work builds on.
