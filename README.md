### Deep Learning for Scientific Computing FS23, Final Project

This is the project repository showcasing our work on using
PINNs to solve radiative transfer problems.

This work was done by Claudio Cannizzaro, Konrad Handrick and Florian Pauschitz.

To run, install dependencies (with a package manger of your choice).

```bash
micromamba create -n dlsc pytorch numpy matplotlib
micromamba activate dlsc
``` 

The concluding report may be found as the PDF file contained in this repository.
