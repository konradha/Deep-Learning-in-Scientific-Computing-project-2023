### Deep Learning for Scientific Computing FS23, Final Project

This is the project repository showcasing our work on using
PINNs to solve radiative transfer problems.

This work was done by 
[Claudio Cannizzaro](https://github.com/caushi)
[Florian Pauschitz](https://github.com/pafloria)
and [Konrad Handrick](https://github.com/konradha).

To run, install dependencies (with a package manger of your choice).

```bash
micromamba create -n dlsc pytorch numpy matplotlib tqdm
micromamba activate dlsc
``` 

The concluding report may be found as the PDF file contained in this repository.
